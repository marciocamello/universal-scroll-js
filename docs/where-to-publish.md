# Where to Publish (English)

Use the article in `blog-post-medium.md` as the base. Adapt title and tone slightly per platform.

## 1. Medium

- Paste the markdown (or export from your editor) into a new Medium story.
- Add a canonical URL to your GitHub repo or npm page if you publish elsewhere first.
- Tags: `javascript`, `webdev`, `opensource`, `npm`, `scrollbar`, `frontend`, `typescript`
- Optional: add 1–2 screenshots or a GIF of the Storybook/demo.

## 2. Dev.to

- Strong dev audience, good for npm/library posts.
- Create a new article and paste the same content; Dev.to supports markdown.
- Tags: `javascript`, `webdev`, `opensource`, `npm`, `tutorial`, `react`, `vue`
- You can cross-post from Medium and set canonical URL to avoid duplicate content issues.

## 3. Hashnode

- Developer-focused, supports markdown and code blocks.
- Good for “I built X” and library announcements.
- Tags: `javascript`, `web-development`, `opensource`, `npm`

## 4. Hacker News (Show HN)

- Post: “Show HN: Universal Scrollbar – one custom scrollbar for all browsers, no fake scroll”
- Link to: GitHub repo, or npm, or the live Storybook.
- Keep the comment section for a short “why I built this” and key technical choices (visual overlay only, native scroll kept).

## 5. Reddit

- **r/javascript** – “Custom scrollbar lib that keeps native scroll (visual overlay only)”
- **r/webdev** – same angle, focus on cross-browser and framework-agnostic.
- **r/reactjs**, **r/vuejs** – if you add a short framework-specific intro.
- Check each sub’s rules; some prefer no pure self-promotion, so lead with the problem/solution and add the link at the end.

## 6. Twitter / X

- Short thread: problem (inconsistent native scrollbars) → approach (visual overlay, native scroll) → link to npm + Storybook.
- One tweet: “One custom scrollbar for every browser. No fake scroll—just a visual overlay. React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, vanilla. [link]”

## 7. LinkedIn

- One post: what problem it solves, who it’s for, link to GitHub/npm/Storybook. Professional tone.

## 8. Product Hunt

- If you want to ship it as a “product”: one clear tagline, 2–3 screenshots or a short video (e.g. Storybook), link to npm or GitHub.

## Suggested order

1. **Dev.to** or **Medium** (full article).
2. **HN Show HN** (link to repo or Storybook).
3. **Reddit** (r/javascript, r/webdev) with a short intro + link.
4. **Twitter/X** and **LinkedIn** (short posts with same link).

Use the same canonical URL (e.g. your Dev.to or Medium post) when cross-posting to avoid duplicate content.
